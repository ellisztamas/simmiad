\title{Estimate spatial clustering}
\usage{
transect_clustering(genotypes, positions)
}
\arguments{
\item{genotypes}{Vector of genotype labels}

\item{positions}{Vector of positions along a linear transect. Should be the
same length as \code{genotypes}.}
}
\value{
Mean distances between sampling points with identical and
non-identical genotype.
}
\description{
Estimate the degree of spatial clustering along a transect
}
\details{
\code{transect_clustering} estimates the degree of non-randomness in the
distribution of genotypes along a linear transect by comparing the mean
pairwise distances between sampling points with the same genotype to mean
pairwise distances between sampling points with non-identical genotypes.
