# Branch history for simmiad package

## 0.1.0_rel_grid-sims

An R package for simulating a population of wild Emmer wheat to ask whether the amount of spatial clustering of unique genotypes can be explained by purely neutral forces.

This simulates a population on an evenly-spaced grid of sampling points through time:

* Sampling points are populated at random with a set of unqiue starting genotypes.
* In the next generation, each sampling point is filled by one seed from the same or a different sampling point from a previous generation. Whichever genotype was at the donor sampling point now occupies the focal sampling point. I assume seed dispersal distances are exponentially distributed with some mean value that is used as an input parameter.
* To allow for a seed bank, each seed can be drawn from any previous generation. The generation is drawn from a poisson distribution.
* Each seed has some probability of having been the product of an outcrossing event. If so, it is assigned a new unique genotype.

## 1.0.0_feat_continuous-space

August 2020. Substantial rewrite of the simulations to allow plants to disperse
in continuous space. This is done on a torus to remove edge effects. I had to
remove the seed dormancy parameter.

## 1.1.0_feat_count-identical

10th September 2020. Changed transect_clustering to return the number of pairs
of identical and non-identical genotypes in the transect.

## 1.2_feat_covar-identity-distance

22.9.2020. Update `transect_clustering` to calculate the correlation between
pairwise identity and distance.

I am not happy with the current measure of spatial clustering
(dividing mean pairwise distance between non-identical pairs by mean pairwise
distance between identical pairs) because it does not account for the absolute
number of identical pairs, so it blows up if there is a small number of identical
pairs.

Other measures I have found seem to be designed for continuous variables and do
but treat distance as discrete (nearest neighbour or not) (for example, Moran's I,
spatial entropy). In this case the outcome is discrete (identical or not) but
the distance is continuous.

The best idea I can come up with is to model spatial
clustering as the (Pearson; using ranks gives ties) correlation between pairwise
identity and distance.
This is not quite as neat as proper spatial autocorrelation stats, because these
return 1 for perfect clustering and -1 for perfect dispersion. The correlation
coeficient becomes negative for clustering but doesn't get much above zero for
perfect dispersion.

## 1.3_feat_compare-all-years

22.9.2020 Compare temporal stability between the last year and all previous
years.

It is not clear exactly what comparison to make for temporal stability. I would
also like to check how temporal stability changes over time. One way to do both
is to compare the final generation n with generation {n-1, n-2, ... , (n-g)+1}
for a total of g replicates.

Update `sim_population` to return a vector of comparisons between years as part
of a longer list of outputs.

## 1.4_feat_set-population-size

22.9.2020. Replace population_size argument with how much bigger the population
should be than the transect.

Currently there are arguments for population size and density, and area is
determined to be size/density. However, since transect length is fixed it can
happen that if population size is small, the width of the torus is less than
the length of the transect. Even if that is not the case, it means that the
distance from edge of the torus to the ends of the transect varies with
population size and density.

To fix this, remove the argument for population size and instead say that the
width of the torus will be 1.5 times the length of the transect, and define
population size as density * width^2. Return population size in the output. This
should affect `sim_population()` and `simmiad()`.

## 1.5_feat_sample-with-1-metre

22.9.2020.

take_trasect() takes the closest plant to each sampling point. Add a check that
a plant should only be sampled if it is within 1m of the sampling point.

## 1.6_feat_identity_at_different_distances

23.9.2020

This originally aimed to address how what we can say about transect A-West, but
is informative more generally. For observed and simulated transects calculate
the probability of observing identical genotypes at sampling points at different
distance classes. You can then plot this as a decaying curve so you can make
statements like "we don't see identical genotypes more than x metres apart".
This can be compared with simulations, which I expect will be much flatter and
lower. This might prove to be a more robust measure of spatial differentiation
than a single number for spatial clustering, but I will calculate both for now.

You can also calculate the probability of observing identical genotypes in
corresponding sampling points 20m away in transect A-West, which I expect will
be higher than you'd get for 20m along either transect or at 20m in simulated
transects.

There is an obvious caveat that estimates for lower distance classes will be
better because there are more comparisons that can be made.

For observed transects, you probably need to average over all sampling years,
because at higher distances things will collapse into a small number of zeroes
and ones.
For simulated transects, estimate this for each year, and return a matrix with
a row for each replicate.
For the A/A-West comparison calculate curves for each transect in 20, plus a
mean for the average between-transect comparison at 20m.

This requires a new function `distance_curve()` that should return all observed
distances and probabilities of seeing a match at each.

## 1.7_feat_output_as_folders

22.9.2020 `simmiad()` saves a folder of summary stats instead of a single file.

For a single call to `simmiad()` with n_generations=g and nsims=r I would like
the function to create a folder of output with several files:

* **log**: Legible text giving date the files were created, package version,
session info, error messages, number of pairs in the transect.
* **parameters**: Table of input parameters to save me having to muck about
extracting these from file names.
* **spatial**: r x g table of spatial clustering stats for every replicate
through time
* **temporal**: r x g table of temporal stability stats for every replicate
comparing the final year to all previous
* **n_genotypes**: r x g table counting the number of unique genotypes in the
whole population for every replicate.
* **transect_matches**: r x g table counting the number of pairs of identical
genotypes in each transect.
* **distance_curves**: matrix giving probabilities of observing identical
genotypes at increasing distances, with a row for each replicate.

This needs updates to both `simmiad()` and `sim_population`.
